# Backend

This directory contains the Python files used to create our backend solution. It is divided into
two main directories: `production` and `training`. The `training` directory contains the files
used for training our RoBERTa model on our preprocessed version of the [Semeval 2020 Task 11](https://propaganda.qcri.org/semeval2020-task11/)
dataset. The `production` directory contains the files used for assembling our backend pipeline with
our trained models.
